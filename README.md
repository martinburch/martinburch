## Welcome to Martin's data things

Recently, I've contributed to [Sling](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aslingdata-io%2Fsling-cli+involves%3Amartinburch&type=issues), [SQLMesh](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ATobikoData%2Fsqlmesh+involves%3Amartinburch&type=issues) and [Superset](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aapache%2Fsuperset+involves%3Amartinburch&type=issues) as part of my work at [Crezco](https://github.com/Crezco-Limited).

Earlier, I wrote a [MySQL upsert function for Python 2](https://gist.github.com/martinburch/c87a5eeb1ba397a0631b555dd93e7382).
